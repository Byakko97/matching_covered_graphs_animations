# Matching Covered Graphs Animations

Animations of algorithms related to matching covered graphs. This project is part of my Bachelor Thesis (under development).

## Usage

The only supported functionality by now is to run an algorithm (without animation)

### Run algorithm

Use the following command to run the algorithm `algo` with the test `test_id`:

```
python3 run.py algo test_id
```

The tests are in the folder `tests` and their ids are the name of the files.

The currently supported algorithms are
